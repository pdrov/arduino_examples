# Simple Arduino examples.
List of simple Arduino examples with the goal of making them more complex. 

- Reading mV on ground pin of servo, I wonder if I can use this as a feedback to create a sensorless feedback loop. Voltage is too low for Arduino, will need to amplify this signal, Arduino accepts 0-5V in analog pins.
